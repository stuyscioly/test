Once again, thank you to those who came, and to those who didn't, well, we're straight out of interest meetings for you to go to. I'm sincerely hoping that many of you see the value and opportunity of joining Science Olympiad not only for the academic rigor but also for the chance to establish a network of fellow nerds you can guarantee will have your back. Good luck to everybody who's taking a placement exam, and I hope you will all be able to join our wonderful team in the future. See you all soon!
