title: Tshirt & Hoodie Design Contest
---

Hey guys! I hope you all have been enjoying your summer and taking some well needed rest from school. This year, we're going to be speeding things up so we can have less mess-ups, hopefully. In light of that, your new VP Troy and I have decided to have the T-shirt/hoodies design contest moved up to now, so people can use their summer free time to really get their creative juices flowing without the burden of hw or projects during the school year. So the details of the contest:

-Use Customink to design your T-shirt/hoodie

-Once you're satisfied with your epicly awesome design, send the design to [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13mxvDhGkbpFlwvoA_QOOqQzdi4CrRzScmJR3uyctqCA/viewform).

-Your design must have "Stuyvesant Science Olympiad" somewhere on the T-shirt and hoodie, in some recognizable shape or form (e.g "Stuy" and "SciOly")

-Due date for the T-shirts and hoodies will be at 23:59 on OCTOBER 13TH, Columbus Day

Here are the Cheng Circles if anybody needs them for their design. They're called Cheng Circles because a fantastic man named Cheng Xing designed them. He is now a Stuyvesant 2012 alumni member. Happy creating!
