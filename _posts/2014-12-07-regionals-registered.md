title: Registered for NYC Regionals!
---


Hi guys, we the admins just wanted to tell you guys that we have officially registered three teams for the New York City Science Olympiad Regionals competition on February 7th, Saturday, at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens. This year, we are proud to present Team Charmander, Team Squirtle, and Team Bulbasaur! Our faculty adviser Ms. Fong facepalmed ridiculously hard when she heard our choices for team names, but our reasoning was that names don't really matter too much if our Pokemon teams all medal at Regionals and bring home trophies. So don't let Ms. Fong down this year and study hard guys!
