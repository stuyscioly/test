title: Deadline for Collecting Apparel Money
---

Hi guys, I'm sorry to change the apparel money collection deadline again, but we're forced to accommodate for the unprecedented rapid dismissal on 12/23. Since we most likely won't be able to get to all of you guys and collect your money in time tomorrow, we're pushing back the deadline. As such, the deadline will be pushed back to the Tuesday we get back to school, 1/6/15. Happy holidays, and get a lot of rest! There's lots of work to be done when we get back
