title: Tshirt & Hoodie Design Contest Update
---
Hey guys!
We forgot to mention something: The winner of the design contest gets their T-shirt or hoodie for free!
For everyone else, the cost is about $15 per T-shirt and $35 per hoodie.
With this incentive in mind, the deadline has been extended to 7pm next Sunday (10/19).
We need your help! When you're ready, send your designs to stuyenceolympiad@gmail.com!
Right now, almost all the designs are freshman-made.
