title: Hello There

Hello and welcome to the new website of Stuyvesant Science Olympiad. I'm Brian Chuk, one of the creators of this site and the former president of Stuyvesant Science Olympiad from 2013 to 2014. We're going to be using this website for important announcements, nonimportant announcements, photos, resources, and other important information.

I'd like to give credit to the contributors of the site:

- [Edmond Loi](https://www.facebook.com/edmond.loi.7) for hosting a hack night at his place where we were able to finally start programming the site and derp around. He's also our president for the 2014-2015 school year.

- [Patrick Tsai](https://github.com/patosai) for the [artistic](https://github.com/StuySciOly/StuySciOly.github.io/tree/artistic) branch of this site and for giving moral support in his short attendance during the hack night. Unfortunately he had to leave early due to his trip to Michigan.

- [Naoki Cho](http://naokicho.com/) for immoral support.

- [Genji Noguchi](https://github.com/genjinoguchi) for programming the [gallery](http://StuySciOly.github.io/gallery.html) page.

- [Johnson Liu](https://www.facebook.com/johnson.liu.71) for giving ideas for pages and contribution to gallery.

- And of course, [yours truly](https://github.com/devchuk).

Oh and by the way if you're interested in seeing the source code you can view it [here](https://github.com/StuySciOly/StuySciOly.github.io)

That's all for now. Keep watching this announcements blog as we are going to have some **major changes** this year.
Also, this is going to be the last blog post from me because I am now a Stuyvesant alumni. It's great to see that we've reached the second highest place so far in the States competition, and I know that we'll just keep getting better and better.

Onwards to Nationals.

~ Brian Chuk
