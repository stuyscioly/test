title: Vote to Change Hoodie Design
---
Hi guys! Thank you for your participation in voting for your favorite T-shirt and hoodide designs this year! Due to public feedback to this year's winning hoodie design, the StuySciOly admins have decided to open up the design to change and modifications. Vote <b><a href="http://strawpoll.me/2931955" target=_blank>HERE</a></b> for whether you would like to change the design or not. If a majority of people do decide to modify or change the design, then we will have further polls in the future to determine what changes to make to appeal to everybody. Thank you for voting! We hope to finalize our designs soon so we can start ordering shortly.<br><br>
